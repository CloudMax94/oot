# Description
The inventory has been moved to 0x0F50 in the Save File (0x8015F5B0 in RAM), so existing files will not have any items in the inventory.

I'll write more, eventually.

# Trade Quests
I do not have any plans on fixing the Trade Quests at the moment. It would be too big of an effort. Consider removing or replacing the Trade Quests with something original instead.

# Console Support
The hack has been tested on an EverDrive 64 throughout development and should work properly.
